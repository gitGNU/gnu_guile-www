* portability (status: bootstrap - build - run)
  |     guile | status    | notes     |
  | 1.4.1.127 | ? - Y - Y | x300 FAIL |
  |     1.8.7 | Y - Y - Y |           |
  |     2.0.6 | ? - Y - Y |           |

* bootstrap: see autogen.sh for required tools

* coding standards
*** indent with emacs (don't like the result? fix emacs!)
*** (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
*** (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
*** everything UTF-8
*** ChangeLog
***** ttn-style: TITLE LF LF {BLURB LF LF}* BODY
***** exclude titles suffixed "; nfc." (no functional change)

* copyright update policy
*** individual files only on change
*** individual years, except for docs (range ok there)
*** 2008+ to ttn

* repo branch discipline
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** archive
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    (Since Guile-WWW is not so popular, we don't bother announcing it.)
*** q-TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
    These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
    to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.
