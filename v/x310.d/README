Z.txt            -- unicode text with CRLF line endings

serveez-logo.jpg -- from GNU Serveez, scaled down 15x
                    (http://www.gnu.org/software/serveez/)

invoke-id.html   -- a ‘form’ with four ‘input’ elements, two
                    file-upload, two text (w/ builtin values)

type, body       -- the type and body, respectively, sampled
                    from running w3m w/ the "local CGI" feature,
                    like so:

                    $ w3m -o cgi_bin=`../../examples ; pwd` invoke-id.html

                    having previously instrumented ‘(www cgi)’ and
                    ‘(www server-utils form-2-form)’ to dump out
                    the raw bytes encountered, and manually selecting
                    Z.txt for ‘file1’ and serveez-logo.jpg for ‘file2’

                    Lastly, body was manually modified to add an explicit
                    Content-Type header for the part named "one".

The final (manual) step for body is not strictly to spec, but the specs
are numerous and voluminous, and we want to test the parsing primarily.
